Swift is a basic C++ library for Linux


Computer Latency Numbers
========================
    L1 cache reference ......................... 0.5 ns
    Branch mispredict ............................ 5 ns
    L2 cache reference ........................... 7 ns
    Mutex lock/unlock ........................... 25 ns
    Main memory reference ...................... 100 ns             
    Compress 1K bytes with Zippy ............. 3,000 ns  =   3 µs
    Send 2K bytes over 1 Gbps network ....... 20,000 ns  =  20 µs
    SSD random read ........................ 150,000 ns  = 150 µs
    Read 1 MB sequentially from memory ..... 250,000 ns  = 250 µs
    Round trip within same datacenter ...... 500,000 ns  = 0.5 ms
    Read 1 MB sequentially from SSD* ..... 1,000,000 ns  =   1 ms
    Disk seek ........................... 10,000,000 ns  =  10 ms
    Read 1 MB sequentially from disk .... 20,000,000 ns  =  20 ms
    Send packet CA->Netherlands->CA .... 150,000,000 ns  = 150 ms

Humanized Latency Numbers
==============
### Minute:
    L1 cache reference                  0.5 s         One heart beat (0.5 s)
    Branch mispredict                   5 s           Yawn
    L2 cache reference                  7 s           Long yawn
    Mutex lock/unlock                   25 s          Making a coffee
### Hour:
    Main memory reference               100 s         Brushing your teeth
    Compress 1K bytes with Zippy        50 min        One episode of a TV show (including ad breaks)
### Day:
    Send 2K bytes over 1 Gbps network   5.5 hr        From lunch to end of work day
### Week
    SSD random read                     1.7 days      A normal weekend
    Read 1 MB sequentially from memory  2.9 days      A long weekend
    Round trip within same datacenter   5.8 days      A medium vacation
    Read 1 MB sequentially from SSD    11.6 days      Waiting for almost 2 weeks for a delivery
### Year
    Disk seek                           16.5 weeks    A semester in university
    Read 1 MB sequentially from disk    7.8 months    Almost producing a new human being
    The above 2 together                1 year
### Decade
    Send packet CA->Netherlands->CA     4.8 years     Average time it takes to complete a bachelor's degree
